<b>How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?</b><br>
User needs can be collected and used to provide direction for the design. It can be determined if they are realistic, deliverable or even combined or made to be more efficient. The structure of the user stories keeps these thoughts and directions on track by providing a template for success. It helps to break down the tasks into achievable increments for the team. To be able to format each into “As a (type of user) I want to (perform some task) so that I can (achieve some goal)”,  allows a clear, simpler achievable direction for development.  This allows organizing it into sizes and priorities for the backlog and later when changes occurred adapt to those new requirements and keep moving forward.

<b>How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?</b><br>
Identify the major needs and develop a strategy, plan and prioritize, design and code/test, evaluate and move in the needed direction. <br>
I would be interested in seeing all, or as many of the various applications as possible. Of course I would want the daily standups, planning, open communications, reviews and retrospectives. I would like to see the Scrum@Scale in action. <br>

<b>What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?</b><br>
I feel that open and continued communication would be the key to success. Being professional and dependable, and working together and supporting each other to achieve the shared goals and returns.
